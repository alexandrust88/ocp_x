To get started let's check that have required roles.

Can we create custom `pizzastands`.

```execute
oc auth can-i create pizzastands
```

Can we create a Kafka cluster.

```execute
oc auth can-i create kafkas
```

Now let's check that `podman` works.

Pull down the `busybox` image:

```execute
podman pull busybox
```

Review the list of images:

```execute
podman images
```

Now run the image:

```execute
podman run --rm -it busybox sh
```

You should be presented with a command line prompt for the shell running inside of the busybox container.

Run:

```execute
busybox | head -1
```

You should see output similar to:

```
BusyBox v1.31.0 (2019-07-16 01:13:11 UTC) multi-call binary.
```

Run:

```execute
exit
```

to exit the container.

Now lets build our own image.

Change to the `tests` directory.

```execute
cd tests
```

Look at what files are in the directory:

```execute
ls -las
```

You should see a `Dockerfile`. This includes the instructions to build the image.

```execute
cat Dockerfile
```

To build the image run:

```execute
podman build -t tests .
```

Review the list of images:

```execute
podman images
```

With the image built, run it:

```execute
podman run --rm -it tests sh
```

Verify that the file `/tmp/helloworld` exists.

```execute
ls -las /tmp
```

Exit from the container:

```execute
exit
```

Lets tag this image:

```execute
podman tag tests image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/%project_namespace%/tests:latest
```

Login to the OpenShift internal registry:

```execute
podman login -u default -p `oc whoami -t` %image_registry%
```

Push the image to the registry:

```execute
podman push %image_registry%/%project_namespace%/tests:latest
```

Verify the image is uploaded:

```execute
oc get is
```

Deploy the image from the registry:

```execute
oc new-app tests:latest
```

Watch it being deployed:

```execute
oc rollout status dc/tests
```

Change back to the top level directory.

```execute
cd
```

Now lets try the operator SDK.

```execute
operator-sdk new pizzastand-operator
```

Change to the directory of the generated files.

```execute
cd pizzastand-operator
```

Add a new API for the custom resource `PizzaStand`

```execute
operator-sdk add api --api-version=workshops.openshift.dev/v1 --kind=PizzaStand
```

Add a new controller that watches for `PizzaStand`.

```execute
operator-sdk add controller --api-version=workshops.openshift.dev/v1 --kind=PizzaStand
```

Build the operator image.

First run this magic command else things don't work.

```execute
go mod vendor
```

Then do the build.

```execute
operator-sdk build %image_registry%/%project_namespace%/pizzastand-operator
```

Push the image to the internal OpenShift image registry.

```execute
podman push %image_registry%/%project_namespace%/pizzastand-operator
```

---

Done for now. Still need to convert the rest.
