To provide a definition for the custom resource type that the Operator is to respond to, you need to create a Custom Resource Definition (CRD). For this example, the custom resource type name we will use is `PodSet`.

Because developers of different Operators may choose to use the same name for a custom resource, resource types are grouped under an API group, where different developers would use their own unique name for the group.

To support the evolution of a custom resource over time, a version name also needs to be specified. The combination of the API group name and the version name is referred to as the API version.

For this example the API version `app.example.com/v1alpha1` is used, corresponding to the API group of `app.example.com` and the version name of `v1alpha1`. See the Kubernetes documentation for more information on [API versioning](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-versioning) and [API groups](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-groups).

To generate the code and YAML files corresponding to the `PodSet` custom resource type, run:

```execute
operator-sdk add api --api-version=app.example.com/v1alpha1 --kind=PodSet
```

The output from the command will list the files it generated.

<span class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></span> Note that this command may show Go compiler errors about unknown imports and finish with a usage error message from the `operator-sdk` program. This is due to an incompatibility between the version of the `operator-sdk` used and the Go compiler. The required files should have been generated okay, so you can ignore the errors and continue with the following steps.

To inspect the generated CRD, which describes the `PodSet` custom resource, run:

```execute
cat deploy/crds/app_v1alpha1_podset_crd.yaml
```

To see an example of the custom resource with appropriate API version and resource type name, run:

```execute
cat deploy/crds/app_v1alpha1_podset_cr.yaml
```

Although the sample custom resource shows a `spec.size` attribute, this is only for example purposes. The next step is to update the generated Go code file corresponding to the resource type and define the custom attributes the resource is to have.
